**My name is David Vingen,** and I'm a 3<sup>rd</sup> (and final) year interaction design student at [Linnaeus University](https://lnu.se/) of Sweden. In a previous millennium, I had the privilege of taking my first steps into the web design world, using table- and frame-based design with marquees and other fun stuff.

**_Design_ was always my forte,** spending countless hours following Photoshop tutorials and making mockups never to be released. (X)HTML and CSS became my way of realizing my Photoshop creations, so I developed a decent footing therein. I made an effort to learn server-side scripting with PHP and MySQL, but never really got the hang of it.

**Come the dot-com bubble,** and I didn't have the confidence to pursue web design as profession. Design and development remained a serious hobby, until a brother of mine wanted to start his own business. I offered to help, having heard about Zen Cart and other open source eCommerce platforms. A few years on I'm working full-time at the company, wading the deep waters of [Magento](https://magento.com/).

**The experience reignited my belief in design and development as profession,** and I proceeded to take a couple of courses introducing me to _interaction design_, which proved to be spot-on for my propensities for design and knowledge-based problem solving.

**So what about JavaScript?** Well, I never really did find it central to my needs. Whatever I needed could usually be found readily made by someone, and much of its appeal at the time seemed to be novelties of less genuine value. Today, this appears different: the web is steadily proving more valuable through further interactivity and dynamic content, JavaScript being a primary vehicle for this development.

As an interaction design student, I hope to attain an understanding of the production-side of interactive artifacts, as well as acquiring the skillset to be able to realize basic projects through my own competencies. I also find the art of writing elegantly designed code with elegant syntax intriguing in itself. And also â€“ _it's just plain fun to tinker with stuff to make stuff happen!_
