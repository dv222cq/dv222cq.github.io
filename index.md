This is my remarkably inventive space, created as part of the course [1DV022 – Klientbaserad webbprogrammering](https://lnu.se/systemsidor/utbildningsplaner/?id=1DV022) (Client-side web programming). The purpose of this site, is to learn how to set up a basic static web site using an SSG (Static Site Generator), as well as using a CSS pre-processor – in this case SASS.

According to the assignment specifications, you will find [some information about me](/about), as well as to [a simple blog implementation](/blog) containing some reflections about SSG's, CSS pre-processors, and so on.

Finally, the site may in the future be used to display other [exercises and assignments](/projects) from this or other courses. We'll have to wait and see about that.

_Regards,  
David._
