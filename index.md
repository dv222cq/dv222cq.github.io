# Welcome to David's space
This is my remarkably inventive space, created as part of the course _1DV022 – Klientbaserad webbprogrammering (Client-side web programming)_. The purpose of this site, is to learn how to set up a basic static web site using an SSG (Static Site Generator), as well as using a CSS pre-processor – in this case SASS.

According to the assignment specifications, you will find links in the menu to some information about me, as well as to a simple blog implementation containing some reflections about SSG's, CSS pre-processors, and so on.

Finally, the site may in the future be used to display other exercises and assignments from this or other courses. We'll have to wait and see about that.

_Regards,  
David._
