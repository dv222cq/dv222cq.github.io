Humans.txt is a quite optional, simple text file, denoting the humans involved with the web site. It is a simple way of providing a "human touch" to any site, and giving credit where credit is due.

The file may be referenced in the site's head, but is kept external to HTML files to avoid cluttering the site.

There are really no requirements, but at [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html){:target="_blank"} you may find suggestions for a standard.

On this site, humans.txt is referenced in the site head, and is placed in the site root, providing short, simple information about the author and the course supervisors, as well as the software and framework used to make the site. You'll find it [here](/humans.txt){:target="_blank"}.
